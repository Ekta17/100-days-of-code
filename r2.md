# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - 2020

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [March 19, 2020].

### Day 1: March 19. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
	1. Started with Java 8 Stream tutorial
	2. Planned to work on Arrays problems on leetcode. 

**Thoughts:** I want to commit to 100 days of code, everyday no matter what. This is my second attempt. I hope to complete the challenge this time. Fingers crossed.
