# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 4 - 2021

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Jan 01, 2021].

### Day 1: Jan 04, 2021. Monday

**Today's Progress:**

1. Heaps operations
2. Heap notes 
3. Problems on heaps: 
    1. Find K largest elements 
    2. Sort a nearly sorted or K sorted Array
    3. Merge K sorted arrays

**Thoughts:** I want to commit to 100 days of code. Starting once again and this is my fourth attempt.
