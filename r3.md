# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 3 - 2020

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Dec 14, 2020].

### Day 1: December 14, 2020. Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
	1. Made a plan to review basic data structures and algorithms
	2. Noted down the technologies I need to learn to be more effective in my current job

**Thoughts:** I want to commit to 100 days of code. Starting once again and this is my third attempt. I hope to complete the challenge this time. Fingers crossed.
