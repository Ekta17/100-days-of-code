# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 3 - 2020

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Dec 14, 2020].

### Day 1: December 14, 2020. Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
	1. Made a plan to review basic data structures and algorithms
	2. Noted down the technologies I need to learn to be more effective in my current job

**Thoughts:** I want to commit to 100 days of code. Starting once again and this is my third attempt. I hope to complete the challenge this time. Fingers crossed.

### Day 2: December 15, 2020. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 
	1. Practiced following problems related to Binary Search Algorithm:
	    - Finding First occurrence of the number in a sorted array
	    - Finding Last occurrence of the number in a sorted array
	    - Count total number of occurrences of the number in a sorted array
	    - Finding First occurrence of the number in a sorted Infinity/Very Large array
	    - Finding First occurrence of the number in a sorted rotated array
	    - Finding peek element in an array
	    - Finding square root of a number
	    

**Thoughts:** I need to increase my speed of problem solving. I am able to understand questions quickly.

### Day 3: December 16, 2020. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 
	1. Practiced following problems related to 2 pointer approach:
	    - Finding pair sum in a sorted array
	    - Finding pair sum in a unsorted array
	    - Finding triplet sum in a sorted array
	2. Used assertArrayEquals statement to assert values in an array
	3. Started a course on Kafka on o'reilly. 
	    

**Thoughts:** I need to devote more time into problem solving. Very slow progress. Create a plan to better manage the day.

### Day 4: December 17, 2020. Thursday

**Today's Progress**:
1. Merge Sort algorithm
2. Insertion Sort algorithm

**Thoughts:** I need to devote more time into problem solving. Very slow progress. Create a plan to better manage the day.

**Link to work:**:
[Merge Sort with Parameterized test cases] (https://github.com/Ekta17/DataStructureAndAlgorithms/tree/main/src/main/java/sorting)


### Day 5: December 18, 2020. Friday

**Today's Progress**:
1. Quick Sort algorithm
2. Union and Intersection problem on Merge sort

**Thoughts:** Today is the first time I understood how exactly the quick sort really works! wow!
